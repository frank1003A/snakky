# Snakky
### Same old snake game with something different
![This is an image](src/assets/snakeimg.jpg)

## Core Concept 

Snakky is a web based snake game. You eat while your score increases, but i added a 
new concept: `exception`. The exception concept entails that random variety of food is 
generated at 3 seconds interval, and the type of food generated and eaten produces an effect on 
a users score.

## Food Exceptions
You can eat them but they have effects on your score during play.
  > Eating snake exception 🐍 sets your score to 0.
  > Eating snake exception 🍕 drops point by 2.
  > Eating snake exception 🧱 ends the game - broken teeth i guess
  > Only positive effect 🥩 add 5 to existing score
  > Eating snake exception 🧃 increases your speed to an uncontrollable state
